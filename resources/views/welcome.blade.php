                        So this was thrown together as a technical test for a backend developer position. 
                        Now I LOVE goal setting. I even facilitate a workshop with a non profit twice a month teaching goal setting
                        and over coming barriers. I created a goal setting journal. I am publishing a book on using ritual habits to achieve goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got carried away with this project and <a href="img/trello.png" target="_blank">started <strong>really</strong> architecting it</a>, and had to slow myself down as the test said "it doesn't need to function". So I was in the middle of creating tests on semaphore and preparing for red/green/refactor sprints, then suddenly realized that I really ought not do that if I want to deliver this test. After all, I had a clear goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I think I will definitely continue to build this out as a side project. Ironically, I used like 3 different goal management/tracking packages as I put this together (one pomodoro tool, Trello, and my own personal one) so why does the world need another goal tracking tool? Simple. I'm applying to a position outside of my city, which means that the course I facilitate for the local non-profit will be down one volunteer leader. It think it would be very cool to leave them a tool that can help the program participants even beyond their sessions.

                    <p>
                        Double irony, the group I work with helps individuals with employment barriers find jobs in a struggling economic situation. Incarceration, single parenting, lack of transportation, illness, language, etc. I help them track and chart themselves toward finding and attaining work, then moving on to financial ease and fulfilling labor. If I left the city for my own career, I'd want them to have something to keep with them after they leave the program themselves. It's an audience I know intimately with a clear series of shared problems. They don't need Trello a project management tool or a shiny silicon valley app. They need a very simple, very free package to help them plan and focus.

                        THAT SAID if you are reviewing this application for my own employment, thank you for the opportunity. And for the inspiration to create a gift for my town.
